SimpleMailBox is a plugin is used for creating mailboxes in Minecraft. It is a fun and easy to use system that adds a new level of fun to minecraft. This plugin is great for role playing servers, as this adds a great community feel.

### How to works: ###
##
It works in a very simple way it has a listener which detects if a player has hit a mailbox and checks if it is theirs. If it is then it will check if they have any mail. If it is not their mailbox then the plugin gets the item that the player is holding and checks if it is a book. If it is then the plugin writes the book to a file. When the player comes to pickup their mail and right clicks on their mailbox, the plugin will find the file and write a book on what is in the file then give it to the player. After this is done the book gets deleted.
